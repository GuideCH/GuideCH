- 👋 Hi, I’m Guide <@GuideCH>
- 👀 I’m interested in FinancialTechnology&investment
- now studying at high school in thai
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about FinancialTechnology&Cryptocurrency
- now investing in stocks since 2019(in my dad portfolio lul)
- 💞️ I’m looking for advice in Cryptocurrency and FinancialTechnology
- working on some funprojects before graduation cuz i want some interesting things in my portfolio 
  -My project
   -TheBookOutbox.com -finance & investment / life&news article website > Now Running 5/100 
   
   -The book tokens >TBT Tokens>for use in school
    Show the usage and how to case of crypto currency, to make crypto currency look easier for youngster (this surely not legal but not that illegal too just fun project of student Lol)
      Create TBO(The book token) base on ERC-20 and back it with THB Money And Host some school Events such as E-sport Using it as Winer price
        and Viewer reward to make them enjoy(sure in the name of my first running project Thebookoutbox.com)
        Then make agreement with near school popular cafe(student is their main customer)
        
          Ex.-10% off while we will cover it with 10% increase- -Ex.100฿ they can pay 90TBT (1฿ each) and we will cover 10฿ 
          or maybe with 10%-XXX% increase so it will be 11฿ that we cover & they will get 101฿-
          
            setup some device with QR code that will transfer back our token then pay cafe in THB with just scan
              (i will back it witn some fiat so it will have value like i might limit 20,000 coin but back it 5,000฿ and let out 5000TBT and tell them it's 1฿ each
                if they left some in wallet and want to use they just need to buy it from me 1.1฿(else1.x)
                or win a price in event or in some activities host by thebook outbox
                
                  this tokens can be sold directly to thebookoutbox in lower than 1.0฿ maybe 0.9or 0.8฿ 
                  i will set it as 0.x<0.9 because i actually want them to exchange each other in 0.X>0.8 rates
                  
                    but if i want profit i will set it 0.9 tho
                    (as if you sell 0.XXXXXXXX amount of some Crypto to fiat then use it but this will run in back door)
                      and i think i will reccommand user to use TRUST wallet -But Now Not Sure i can This project i cose 2k$ or 60,000 thb at least hahaha -running 0/100
                        "trouble is  idk how to run the process of buying at cafe using QR code method that will not troubling the user.....
                        i have no knowledge at back door process so if u have some advice"
